    <h1>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</h1>
    <p>
      Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to
      admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected
      a few of our favorite shots here.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="bread.html"
        ><img
          src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg"
          alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread" /></a
      ><br />
      We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and
      dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food
      shelter.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Burgers</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="burgers.html"
        ><img src="../gallery/thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="burger"
      /></a>
      <br />

      People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our
      own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and
      free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping
      combos or stick with the classics.
    </p>

    <h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="fish.html"
        ><img src="../gallery/thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="fish" /></a
      ><br />

      Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to
      offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted
      Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.
    </p>

    <h2>Fried Chicken Legs</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="../gallery/chicken.html">
        <img
          src="../gallery/thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg"
          alt="fried chicken"
        /> </a
      ><br />
      Daring chicken legs fired to the brown color of caramel. Lads who made
      them love making people smile. You know.
    </p>

    <h2>Fries for the fish</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="../gallery/fries.html"
        ><img src="../gallery/thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="catch of the day"
      /></a>
      <br />
      Who doesn't like fries that often come with a burger and a cup of cold
      coke. People at our restraunt always get at least one plate of these yummy
      things.
    </p>
    <h2>Tabouleh of the day</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="../gallery/tabouleh.html"
        ><img src="../gallery/thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="tabouleh" /></a
      ><br />This a dish of my childhood. My mamma would often make us help her
      with the dishes while she was making tabouleh.
